            <h1>What You Know About Fish</h1>

            <p>
                All fish share two traits: they live in water and they have a backbone—they are vertebrates.

                Apart from these similarities, however, many of the species in this group differ markedly from one
                another. Fin fish like salmon have gills, are covered in scales, and reproduce by laying eggs. Eels, by
                contrast, have worm-like bodies and exceedingly slimy skin. Lungfish gulp air. Whale sharks, the largest
                fish, give birth to live young and eat only tiny fish, squid, and plankton. Some species, such as the
                weedy sea dragon, are so bizarre they seem almost unreal.

                Fish have developed special senses, too. Because water transmits sounds, disperses chemicals, and
                conducts electricity better than air, fish rely less on their vision and more on their hearing, taste,
                and smell. Many can detect motion in the water using a special row of scales with sensors known as the
                lateral line. Others can find their prey and even navigate by detecting electrical charges.

                One reason fish are so diverse is that 70 percent of the planet is covered in water. The animals in this
                group live in a variety of habitats ranging from coral reefs and kelp forests to rivers, streams, and
                the open ocean. Another is that fish are very old on the evolutionary scale. According to fossil
                records, they have been on Earth for more than 500 million years! The total number of living fish
                species—about 32,000— is greater than the total of all other vertebrate species (amphibians, reptiles,
                birds, and mammals) combined.

            <h6>FROM THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC BOOK, ANIMAL ENCYCLOPEDIA, 2012</h6>
            <h2>
                Air-breathing
            </h2>
            <p>
                Channa argus has a special chamber adjacent to its gills called a suprabranchial organ. This allows the
                animal to absorb oxygen directly from air by gulping it in through its mouth. This adaptation enables
                snakeheads to thrive in low-oxygen, stagnant bodies of water in a variety of settings, from swamps to
                muddy rivers to canals to ponds. It can survive outside of water for up to four days.

                However, snakeheads can also use their gills to respire underwater, which they often do in the winter
                months. In summer, and in warmer conditions—which necessitates more oxygen—the fish solely breathes air
                though its suprabranchial organ.

                The northern snakehead is not alone in this ability: Walking catfishes, lungfishes, and betta fish can
                all breathe air directly as well.
